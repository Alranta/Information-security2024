# H2 Kill Chain
## Read (or listen) and summarize. [Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)

### 1. Introduction
- As long as there has been computer networks and information stored there, there has been hackers trying to exploit these networks.
-Risk of compromising economic data or military advancement has been given name **Advanced Persistent Threat** or **APT**
-Hackers use socially-engineered emails to dropping trojans or malware to gain access to **backdoors in software, or exfiltrate important information.**
-2010 iSec partners noted that **anti-virus and patching software are NOT sufficient,** because end users are targeted, and they should practise security hygiene.
-Hackers use **advanced tools, customized malware and "zero-day" exploits.**
-Using **phase based models** we can get advantage.

### 2. Related work
-Kill chain **2F2TEA, Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage and Assess** has been used to identify gaps in USA Airforce, but this is also used outside of military, example information security companies.
-**Attack-Based Sequential Analysis of Countermeasures (ABSAC)** Is an frawmework to counter during the time of an attack. It is used postcompromise, and doesnt lean to early detection.
-**Situational Crime Prevention (SCP)** Is a phase model made to understand the criminal and hacker, and his actions and coming steps in the crime.

### 3. Intelligence-driven **Computer Network Defence (CND)**
-It is a risk management strategy that addresses the threat component of risk, incorporating analysis of adversaries, their capabilities, objectives, doctrine and limitations.
-It is a continous process and its meaning is to understand the intrusions of a hacker, not singular events.
-Hackers adjust their actions based success or failure of each attempt.
-Kill chain model aims to break the attacker chain by mitigating one of the moves by hacker.

### 3.1 Indicators and the Indicator lifecycle
-Three types of indicators:
 1. **Atomic**: Remains their value mostly and cannot be broken into pieces: email addresses, IP addresses
 2. **Computed**: Derived data, usually from an incident: hash values, regex
 3. **Behavioral**: Collection on Computed and Atomic indicators.

 ### 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain
 -Hacker wants to breach in to a trusted boundary, and hide their presence there. Only after this they can take actions against their objectives
 -**Computer Network Attack (CNA)**
 -**Computer Network Espionage (CNE)**
 -**CNA and CNE Kill Chain phases:**
    1. **Reconnaissence:** Gather intel from where to breach. Identify and select targets, gather e-mail addresses, gain intel of technology
    2. **Weaponization:** Creating remote access and executable code, that will gain backdoor access.
    3. **Delivery:** Moving weapon to targer environment, example e-mail with a pdf attachment.
    4. **Exploitation:** Triggering hackers code in target environment. 
    5. **Installation:** Gaining remote access.
    6. **Command and Control (C2):** Hacker has "hands on access to keyboard"
    7. **Actions on Objectives:** Now hacker can work toward its goals. Example data exfiltration.

### 3.3 Courses of Action
-Taking actions against kill chain we can defend ourselves better
    1. **Detect:** Detect using network analytics or firewall analytics
    2. **Deny:** Deny access from certain ip
    3. **Disrupt:** Disrupt attacker
    4. **Degrade:** Degrade attacker
    5. **Deceive:** Deceive attacker
    6. **Destroy:** Destroy info

### 3.4 Intrusion Reconstruction
-Important to reconstruct attack, eventhough it wasnt succesful, it could help find something else.
-Important to move up and down the kill chain, to find other exploits.

### 3.5 Campaing Analysis
-Analyzing multiple intrusions will find commonalities and overlapping qualities.
-Goal is to find patterns and behaviors intruders: their **Tactics, Techniques and Prodecures (TTP)**
-More important to know how they operate, not what
-Understand the intent of the hacker

### 4 Case Study

### 4.1 Intrusion attempt 1
-Infected pdf that used shellcode to make a backdoor and send data to hacker server
-Pdf was copy of a legit one

### 4.2 Intrusion attempt 2
-Infected pdf that used shellcode to make a backdoor and send data to hacker server
-Pdf was copy of a legit one
-Sender ip address was different than the one before
-Same exploit

### 4.3 Intrusion attempt 3
-Was noticed because of an indicator overlap! (Same ip as in intrusion attempt 2)
-PowerPoint file was the infected file this time
-Zero-day exploit, exploit was not known by Microsoft or anyone else

### 5 Summary
-Intelligence-driven computer network defence is neccesity, and it is continous work!
-Kill Chain provides a structure to understand attackers intentions, extract indicators

## Technical report of installation of Oracle Virtualbox and Debian 12 Bookworm

### 1. Go to [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) And select your operating system from the list. I have a windows so I chose windows. After selecting, it will download virtualbox installer.exe, run this program.

### **CONFIGURING VIRTUALBOX**
-Follow installer instructions. It will turn off your network for a while, but dont worry.
-After installation open virtual box

### After installation: Download Debian 12 live iso from  [https://www.debian.org/download](https://www.debian.org/download)
-I installed debian-12.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso

### After downloading, open VirtualBox and press New.
![Virtualbox installer](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20100533.png)

### I pressed Expert mode to configure install better, you should too.

### I gave my Virtual Machine a name, Debian.

### Select ISO image, the one you downloaded! 
![Virtualbox installer](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20101018.png
### Select skip unattended install, this will start installation from the beginning, and your distro will not have an account!

### Select Hardware for your install, I choose Base memory to be 4096mb, and 2 CPU.
![Virtualbox installer 1](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20101243.png)
### I created virtual hard disk, 40 gb will be enough for our purpose.

### I chose to install Debian without graphical interface.
### Select language, timezone and keymap for install. I chose english install but remember to use your keyboard mapping! I chose finnish mapping.

### Select hostname and domainname, I choose alvari

### Set up rootpasswd. This is important!
-Later note! Dont set up rootpasswd.
### Set up user full name and username and password for user. I used my name alvari for username.

### Select to use full disk for partition.
-Select recommended for new users.

### Select mirror for your install. deb.debian.org is good.

### You can select what software you want to install, Select system utilities only!
-Make sure you uncheck the graphical interface!
### Select grubloader, use the device you choose

### After this Debian will install!
![Installing](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20102945.png)
### After install Debian will reboot.
- I accidentally downloaded the graphical interface during my first install. Oops.
![Debian](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20105317.png)
- **IF YOU SET ROOT PASSWD, SUDO WILL NOT BE INSTALLED!**
- su -, enter root passwd, apt install sudo, logout

### How to update
-I had some problems, but after adding manually my user to sudo, I could update.
- su -, enter root passwd. enter command "sudo visudo" and add your username under root.
![visudo file](./photos/Näyttökuva%202024-08-30%20113549.png)
-Now you can sudo apt-get update!
-Also remember to upgrade: sudo apt-get upgrade

### Installing apache2
-use command: sudo apt install apache2
-You can check status of apache2 with command sudo systemctl status apache2
