## Disobey 2024: [[D24] How Much Dirty Laundry Are Your Smart Home Devices Airing About You - Jack Fitzsimons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWv0Z_FePKU)

### Why smart devices? Presenter picked a washing machine and an automatic vacuum "roomba"
1. People want products that have better features. Like automation and remote control/access.
2. It is hard to buy "dumb" products, because companies want to stand out in competition with features.

### He bought two smart watches because the roomba died, and the washing machine went to his mother-in-law. We will focus on the smartwatches and their apps. Apps are Samsung gear, and garmin for Android and IOS.

1. 180 million smartwatches in the world, 92% use them for fitness and tracking
2. He chose smartwatches because they keep inside them valuable data about the person.
3. When things go wrong with smartwatches:
 - "Fitness tracking app Strava gives away secret location of US army base"
 - "Ukraine war: Russian ex-commander shot dead during jogging"
 - "Husband admits murdering wife as smartwatch Data Exposes his cover-up"
 4. Googles fit-bit had an part in their privacy policy that they will give your information out to law or govermental request, if the request is important enough

 ### **IMPORTANT: READ THE DOCS!!**
 1. Read privacy policy
 2. Look at the permissions each app requests
 3. Look at any SDKs or third party apps that data is shared with

 ### Took a look inside
 1. He reverse engineered the apps
 2. Monitored web traffic with a proxy
 3. Captured logs with a custom DNS

 ### What data Samsung and Garmin watch collects of you?

 Common: Name and date of birth, email address, location, payment info, calls and message logs, calender.
 Samsung: Voice and Full application list of your device
 Garmin: Photos, Audio, body characteristics and sleep data

 Samsung: If you consent to use their app, it will run a scan of your network and see if you have other samsung devices, like a washing machine and pass all of the data to that device also.

 Samsung also said that they dont collect data from children, but they in fact collect all of the same data.

 Permissions: All of the apps will use your fine location.

 ### SDKs (Software Developments Kits) [EXODUS The privacy audit platform for Android applications](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/)
 **Great website to check out your apps!**
1. This app does your app have trackers and what permissions the app users.

### Unpacking and decompiling the apps
1. Decompiling the app we could get some clues about our data usage

### How and what are we looking for?
1. apktool for Android devices and ios-Frida-dump for ios apps.
2. Keywords like sdk, partner, third party
How? Search through the code by opening decompiled app in text editor

In Samsung gear app search "sdk" found 779 results in 317 files. 
In Garmin connect app search "sdk" found 13199 results in 2009 files. Commonly it was facebook or google sdk.

### Monitoring web traffic with a proxy
He used Burp Suite to penetrate test and find out the data inside the apps.

### Rest of the app:
Files werent clear. 

### DNS logs to understand where data might be shared:

Samsung had microsoft analytics and google.
Garmin had the same.

### Is one app better than the other?
IOS was a bit more shady.

### Why is this data even valuable? Is it really only for advertisement?
Yes it is. Health insurance companies might buy your health data and see that you have a new condition, and raise prices on the contract.
Health insurance companies will also give good deals to apple watches etc to monitor your health, but raise the price if you dont exercise or your health goes down.

### Is there anything we can do about the data collection?
We cant block the app endpoints because the app would break
We can block some thirdparties! 
Can you use the watch only, no app? Yes and no. With garmin you can!
Self host to keep your data? Yes, there is alternatives for the backend to selfhost!

### What did we learn?
It is really hard to have smartwatch or smart device with privacy conscious.
End result is pretty bad and dumb watch.

### Strinking a balance?
Do we need all the data collected?
**READ THE PRIVACY POLICIES**
Change a bit at the time!

## Portscanning my pc before installing apache2

You can see that port 80 is not in use, because apache2 uses port 80 for HTTP.

## After installing daemon (apache2)

Now you can see port 80 in use!
