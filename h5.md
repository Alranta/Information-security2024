## Read and a summarize: 

## [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec006)

### Foundations:

### 1.1 Terminology:
Sender and Receiver, self explanatory. Sender and Receiver

### Messages and Encryption:
- Message with no encryption is called **Plaintext** or **Cleartext**
- Discuising **Plaintext** such way to hide its substance is **Encryption**
- **Encrypted** **Plaintext** is called **Ciphertext**
- Turning **Ciphertext** to **Plaintext** is called **De-cryption**

### Common functionals:
```

C = Ciphertext
D = Decryption
E = Encryption
M = Message (Sometimes also P = Plaintext)

E(M) = C -- Encrypting message makes ciphertext

D(C) = M -- Decrypting ciphertext makes message

D(E(M)) = M Decrypting encrypting message makes message
 
```

### Authentication, Integrity and Nonrepudiation

Authentication is for the receiver to authenticate who sent the encrypted message

Integrity receiver should be possible to verify that message has not been tampered on the way

Nonrepudiation Sender should not be able to deny later that he sent the message

### Algorithms and Keys

**Cryptographic algorithm also called cipher,** is used for the encryption and decryption.

**Key** is used in encryption and in decryption. The range of possible values is called **Keyspace**

### Common functionals now becomes:
```

C = Ciphertext
D = Decryption
E = Encryption
M = Message (Sometimes also P = Plaintext)

K = Key

EK(M) = C -- Encrypting message with key makes ciphertext

DK(C) = M -- Decrypting ciphertext with key makes message

DK(EK(M)) = M Decrypting with key encrypting with key message makes message
 
```

Keys allow to keep cryptographic algorithm public, because it can only be opened with a key.

A **Cryptosystem** is an algorithm, with all plaintext, ciphertext and keys.

### Symmetric Algorithms.

**Symmetric:**
- Key must remain a secret with sender and reciever
- Key can be calculated from decryption key and vice versa
- Also called secret-key algorithm and single-key algorithm or one-key algorithm

Can be divided to two main categories:
- **Stream ciphers** or **stream algorithms**
- **And Block ciphers** or **block algoritms**

**Public Key:**
- Also called Asymmetric algorithms
- Key used for encryption is different from key used to decryption
- Cannot be calculated from either one
- Encryption key can be public because of this.
- Encryption key is called usually **Public key**
- Decryption key is called usually **Private key**


### Cryptanalysis
- Cryptanalysis is called when someone tries to get through siphertext without the key.
- Cryptanalysis is attack
- Four general types of attack:

1. Cyphertext-only attack
- Attacker has many ciphertexts, tries to open the texts or extract a key to open all of them

2. Known-plaintext attack
- Attacker has access also to plaintexts, and tries to extract key to open new messages.

3. Chosen-plaintext attack
- Attacker can choose which plaintext gets encrypted. 

4. Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack.
- Attacker has info and knows what to encrypt next.

Also three other styles of attacks:

5. Chosen-ciphertext attack
- Attacker can choose different ciphertexts to be encrypted

6. Chosen-key attack
- Attacker has some knowledge of relationship between keys

7. Rubber-hose cryptanalysis
- Threatening, blackmailing or torture to get the key
- Bribery is sometimes called a purchase-key attack

Encrypted source code is especially vulnerable because of the regular appearance of keywords: #define, struct, else, return. Encrypted executable code has the same kinds of problems: functions, loop structures, and so on.

Keeping your algortihm secret is not good. It will get reverse-enginereed and cracked.

Best algorithms we have are the ones that are public. Anyone can make them better

If the algorithm is commercial it will get bought and analyzed.

### Security of algorithms

Different algorithms give different degrees of security
It depends how hard they are to break

Lars Knudsen different categories of breaking and algorithm. In decreasing order of severity

1. Total break, attacker has the key
2. Global deduction, finding an alternate algorithm without knowing the key
3. Instance or local deduction, attacker finds the plaintext of ciphertext.
4. Information deduction, Attacker finds out some information about the key or plaintext

Algorithm is safe if there is not enough information in the ciphertext to crack the plaintext.
Ciphertext-only attack are crackable, trying every key possible one by one. This is called **Bruteforce**

Measuring the complexity of an attack:

1. Data complexity, hwo much data does the attacker need
2. Processing complexity, Time needed for the attack
3. Storage requirements. The memory needed for the attack

### Steganography

- Hiding the hidden message, inside the hidden message
- Hiding something in like example picture.

### Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers.

**Substitution Ciphers**

- Each plaintext character is changed to another character in ciphertext
These include fourtypes:

- A simple substitution cipher: Each character is changed with a corresponding character in ciphertext.
- A homophonic substitution cipher: One character can map to several characters in ciphertext
- A polygram subsitution cipher: Blocks of characters are encrypted in groups.
- A polyalphabetic substitution cipher is made of multiple simple substituion ciphers.
- Caesar cipher: Each plaintext character is replaced by character three to the right.
- ROT13: Every letter in plaintext is rotated 13 places. Encrypt twice you get plaintext back.
- Transposition cipher, plaintexxt is same but the characters are shuffled

Vigenere cipher?

Rotor was a machine to automate crypting. 

XOR is not good encryption.

### One-Time-Pad

- Can be used only once because the papers are destroyed
- Keys should not overlap
- Only works on short messages

### Computer Algorithms

- DES: Data Encryption Standard, symmetric algorithm.
- RSA: ( named from creators: Rivest, Shamir, Adleman), The most popular public-key algorithm. Can be used encryption and digital signature.
- DSA: (Digital Signature Algorithm,) Can be used for digital signature but not for encryption


## [Karvinen 2023:  PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/)

1. Install gpg, micro and psmic

> sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

2. Generate your own public key

> gpg --gen-key

3. Now we have our key. Now we want to export public key so others can use it to decrypt their message to us.

> gpg -- export --armor --output alvari.pub (alvari.pub is just a mockname)

4. Now we create Alice, and Alices public key.

> mkdir alice
> cd alice
> gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

We did this so every command with --homedir runs in directory alice.

5. Generate key for Alice.

> gpg --homedir . --gen-key

6. We import Alvari public key to Alice directory

> cd
> cp -v alvari.pub alice/

7. We go to Alice directory

> cd alice
> gpg --homedir . --import alvari.pub

8. Alice check the fingerprint

> gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

9. Calling Alvari and checking that the fingerprint is correct

10. Alice signs key

> gpg --homedir . sign-key "HERE COMES THE FINGERPRINT"

Now we see trust

> gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

[ full ] Alvari Rantapelkonen

11. Now we need Alices key so we know its her.

> gpg --homedir . --export --armor --output alice.pub

Copy the key to alvari home folder.

> cp -v alice/alice.pub .

12. We import the key:

> gpg --import alice.pub

13. We call Alice to get the fingerprint and verify its her

> gpg --sign-key "ALICES FINGERPRINT"
> gpg --fingerpring 
[ full ] Alice

14. Now we send a message using micro.

> micro message.txt

15. Now we encrypt and sign it with alvari public key

> gpg --homedir . --encrypt --recipent alvari@email.fi.mock --sign --output encrypted.pgp --armor message.txt

Now we have encrypted message named encrypted.pgp.

Lets copy it to our homedirectory so we can encrypt it.

> cp -v alice/encrypted.pgp .

and now I will decrypt it.

> gpg --dercypt encrypted.pgp

We should see a message in the end: **gpg: Good signature from Alice alice@email.fi.mock [full]**
