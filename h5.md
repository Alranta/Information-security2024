## Read and a summarize: 

## [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec006)

### Foundations:

### 1.1 Terminology:
Sender and Receiver, self explanatory. Sender and Receiver

### Messages and Encryption:
- Message with no encryption is called **Plaintext** or **Cleartext**
- Discuising **Plaintext** such way to hide its substance is **Encryption**
- **Encrypted** **Plaintext** is called **Ciphertext**
- Turning **Ciphertext** to **Plaintext** is called **De-cryption**

### Common functionals:
```

C = Ciphertext
D = Decryption
E = Encryption
M = Message (Sometimes also P = Plaintext)

E(M) = C -- Encrypting message makes ciphertext

D(C) = M -- Decrypting ciphertext makes message

D(E(M)) = M Decrypting encrypting message makes message
 
```

### Authentication, Integrity and Nonrepudiation

Authentication is for the receiver to authenticate who sent the encrypted message

Integrity receiver should be possible to verify that message has not been tampered on the way

Nonrepudiation Sender should not be able to deny later that he sent the message

### Algorithms and Keys

**Cryptographic algorithm also called cipher,** is used for the encryption and decryption.

**Key** is used in encryption and in decryption. The range of possible values is called **Keyspace**

### Common functionals now becomes:
```

C = Ciphertext
D = Decryption
E = Encryption
M = Message (Sometimes also P = Plaintext)

K = Key

EK(M) = C -- Encrypting message with key makes ciphertext

DK(C) = M -- Decrypting ciphertext with key makes message

DK(EK(M)) = M Decrypting with key encrypting with key message makes message
 
```

Keys allow to keep cryptographic algorithm public, because it can only be opened with a key.

A **Cryptosystem** is an algorithm, with all plaintext, ciphertext and keys.

### Symmetric Algorithms.

**Symmetric:**
-Key must remain a secret with sender and reciever
-Key can be calculated from decryption key and vice versa
-Also called secret-key algorithm and single-key algorithm or one-key algorithm

Can be divided to two main categories:
-**Stream ciphers** or **stream algorithms**
-**And Block ciphers** or **block algoritms**

**Public Key:**
-Also called Asymmetric algorithms
-Key used for encryption is different from key used to decryption
-Cannot be calculated from either one
-Encryption key can be public because of this.
-Encryption key is called usually **Public key**
-Decryption key is called usually **Private key**
