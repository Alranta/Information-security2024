### Foundations:

### 1.1 Terminology:
Sender and Receiver, self explanatory. Sender and Receiver

Messages and Encryption:
- Message with no encryption is called **Plaintext** or **Cleartext**
- Discuising **Plaintext** such way to hide its substance is **Encryption**
- **Encrypted** **Plaintext** is called **Ciphertext**
- Turning **Ciphertext** to **Plaintext** is called **De-cryption**

### Common functionals:
```

C = Ciphertext
D = Decryption
E = Encryption
M = Message (Sometimes also P = Plaintext)

E(M) = C -- Encrypting message makes ciphertext

D(C) = M -- Decrypting ciphertext makes message

D(E(M)) = M Decrypting encrypting message makes message
 
```

Authentication, Integrity and Nonrepudiation

Authentication is for the receiver to authenticate who sent the encrypted message

Integrity receiver should be possible to verify that message has not been tampered on the way

Nonrepudiation Sender should not be able to deny later that he sent the message
