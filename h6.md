### 2.3 One-Way Functions

- One-way functions are easy to compute, but hard to reverse.
- Example: **Given x, it is easy to compute f(x), but not given x, it is hard to compute f(x)**
- Example 2: write your message into a plate, and smash that plate. It is easy to smash the plate, but almost impossible to glue it back to together.
- No mathematical proof of them existing.
- Message with one-way function is not good. Example 2, your friend can see that there is a message, but cannot decrypt it.
- **A trapdoor one.way function** is a good way to use one-way functions. It has a secret "trapdoor" to compute the function backwards:


"""

Easy to compute = given x, f(x)
Hard to compute, or almost impossible = f(x)
Possible to compute = given y, secret trapdoor f(x), y

"""
