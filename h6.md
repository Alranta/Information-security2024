## [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

### 2.3 One-Way Functions

- One-way functions are easy to compute, but hard to reverse.
- Example: **Given x, it is easy to compute f(x), but not given x, it is hard to compute f(x)**
- Example 2: write your message into a plate, and smash that plate. It is easy to smash the plate, but almost impossible to glue it back to together.
- No mathematical proof of them existing.
- Message with one-way function is not good. Example 2, your friend can see that there is a message, but cannot decrypt it.
- **A trapdoor one-way function** is a good way to use one-way functions. It has a secret "trapdoor" to compute the function backwards:


```

Easy to compute = given x, f(x)
Hard to compute, or almost impossible = f(x)
Possible to compute = given y, secret trapdoor f(x), y

```
- Good example of secret trapdoor is taking apart a watch. Easy to take apart but without instructions almost impossible to put together.


### 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

Dear child has a lot of names:

Compression function, 
contraction function, 
message digest, 
fingerprint, 
cryptographic checksum, 
message integrity check (MIC), 
and manipulation detection code (MDC)

- It is a function that takes a variable-length input string called **Pre-image** and converts it to output string called **hash value.**

- A simple hash function would be a function that takes pre-image and returns a byte consisting of the XOR of all the input bytes.
- Point is to **fingerprint** the **pre-image**, whether a candidate pre-image is the same as real pre-image.
- Hash-functions are usually **many-to-one**, meaning that we cannot be sure that two strings are equal.

- Works in one direction: It is easy to compute a hash value from pre-image, but hard to generate pre-image from hash value.
One-way hash function is also **collision free**: it is hard to generate two pre-images with same hash value.

- Hash functions are public, security comes from its one-wayness. 
- Useful for verifying that people have same files without transferring the files. Checking that the hashes of the file match.

- **Message Authentication Codes (MAC) or Data Authentiction Code (DAC)**
- Is a one-way hash function with addition of secret key.
- hash value is a function of pre-image AND **key**
- Only difference that the person with the key can verify the hash!
