## [Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

### 1. Tor Still works

- NSA (National Security Agency) still hasnt figured out a way to fully circumvent the anonymity provided by tor.
- They have used exploits in tor browser bundle and misconfiguration of user.
- Tor has not been broken down in cryptographic level.

### 2. Tor is not only used by criminals

- Activists use tor to keep their anonymity
- Journalists use tor to keep whistleblowers safe.
- Families use tor to keep their children safe.
- Military people use onion routing for secure communications and planning

### 3. Tor Does not have a military backdoor

- No backdoor, because it is open source. Anyone can view the sourcecode and do commits to it.


### 4. No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a tor relay

- Tor relay is a computer or a server, through tor send your information. You can also host one if you want to.
- Nobody has been prosecuted fo running a tor relay.

### 5. Tor is easy to use.

- Download tor browser bundle and start tor browser.
- Another good way to use tor is through tailsos. Tails is a bootable os from usb or dvd, and it will "forget" what you did.

### 6. Tor is not as slow as you think.

- Tor is slower than regular internet connection because it goes through three servers, and not one.
- Making more relays makes it faster, so think of committing and becoming relay hoster!

### 7. Tor is not foolproof.

- Tor is not perfect. You can destroy your own anonymity if you use it wrongly.
- Keep tor browser updated at all times! 
- Services like facebook and google acan see you communications inside the services, so dont use them!

### Introduction:

- One of the most impactful technologies in the anonymous internet.
- Modified from the popular firefox browser
- By hiding the true ip address of the user.
- Tor combines anonymity and ease of use, so that anyone can use it.

### History and intended use of the onion router.

- Tor's intention is to allow unfettered and anonymous communication over the internet.
- It is legal to use! Your car can tkae kids to school but same car can be used to run over grandmas. 
- Originally developed by the US goverment, it is not controlled anymore by the goverment. It is open source.

### How the onion router works?

- Tor directs your internet traffic and usage through three tor relays, and it is encrypted three times.
- Encrypted with elliptic curve cryptography.
- Entry relay removes first layer of encryption and is send to the second relay.
- Second relay removes second layer of encryption
- Third relay removes third layer of encryption and now the encrypted ciphertext is plaintext.
- The exit relay doesnt know anything but the traffic comign from the previous relay.
- Making it even more difficult is that tor changes all the relays in 10 minutes.
- "Onion routing" comes from the layers of encryption. 

### Tracking criminals using tor

- Every goverment agency is working to deanonymize tor.
- Most of the succeeded "busts" are faulty of the users, and not goverments cracking tor.
- Practise good opsec and security hygiene!

### It is possible to break tor. FBI did it... once... at least once...

- Child pornography hosting service was identified and taken down by the fbi using an exploit in firefox.
- Biggest weakness of tor is its user.
- Dont use location!
- Dont use plugins, turn off javascript.
- Many theories has been used to find vulnerabilities, identify users and decrypt data.
- Attackign and disabliing large amount of tor is one them.
- They have tried to control the nodes, but that doesnt also work.
- Common goal is to get true ip-adress (the one your own computer uses to send)
- When using tor gettigng your ip adress is really difficult
- People will try to capitalize on your mistakes. Like sending you and email that contains html and javascript, and it will give the blackmailer your ip address.
- Another way to obtain your ip is sending a document with tracking to you. Try to open them offline or inside a virtual machine.

### One mistake results in a lifetime in prison

- He used is personal e-mail address and real name on open internet to get help with bitcoin venture. This got the investigators notice and made investigations much easier.
- Internal corporate networks can see that someone is using tor inside their network.
